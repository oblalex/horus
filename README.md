IL-2 Horus system
-----------------

**WARNING! This repo is abandoned! It was splitted into a [set of separate projects].**

Main purpose of this project is to create a set of different tools for
working with [IL-2 Sturmovik] dedicated server.

The central place among all tools is taken by controlling and statistics gathering system
for dedicated server. That system is going to become an alternative to
[IL2 Server Commander] and [FBDaemon].
